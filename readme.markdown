# couchlegs

the idea here is wrap some stuff to make it easy to initialize your couch for testing etc.
so things that change often during dev, and which whould be tested, are easy to setup.

couchlegs was actually made to make it easy to setup multiple couch databases at once. i've since realised that it was a better idea to use multiple types in one database instead of multiple databases with one type per database, so i've stopped using this.

instead use http://githib.com/dominictarr/cradle-init
